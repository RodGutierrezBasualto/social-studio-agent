#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Installs a launchd agent that fires the cron tick every minute.
#
# Why the tick is driven from the machine at all: the hosted deployment had
# pg_cron call this endpoint, but a local Postgres container cannot reach the
# app, so something outside the database has to poke it.
#
# Why the plist is self-contained rather than calling scripts/cron-tick.sh:
# macOS TCC does not extend a Terminal's access to protected folders
# (~/Desktop, ~/Documents) to launchd agents. An agent pointed at a script
# inside this project fails with "Operation not permitted" and never runs. So
# the schedule, the URL and the secret are baked into the plist in
# ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and logs go to ~/Library/Logs — none of which is
# protected. Re-run this script after changing CRON_TICK_SECRET or the port.
#
# The tick only succeeds while the app is running. When it is down the request
# fails and is logged; that is expected, and it is why automations only advance
# while the app is up.
